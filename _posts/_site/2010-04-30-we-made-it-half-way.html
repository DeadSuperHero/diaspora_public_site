<p>Wow! After just one week, we are now half-way to our goal!  It has been a really crazy ride for us, <a href="http://twitter.com/starkness/status/13046623398">the support</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/hult/status/13077480233">excitement</a> we have been getting is absolutely <a href="http://twitter.com/brokep/status/13078993912">unreal</a>.  However, there is still half way to go!  We (the team) are still thinking of new ways we can reach people, and we certainly won&#8217;t stop working hard to make sure we achieve our goal.  So many of you have reached out to us to lend a hand, and if you have been helping us out, or even just reposting our stuff, thank you so much!</p>
<p>We have a couple of cool things to announce next week, so be sure to keep a look out another post sometime soon for more info about that.  It has been great following many of you on <a href="http://twitter.com/joindiaspora">Twitter</a> to see that so many people are excited about these problems as we are.  Every time we see a new relevant update from you all reminds us why we want to make Diaspora.</p>
<p>Thanks to all for being so awesome, we can&#8217;t wait till our finals are over so we can get crackin&#8217; on Diaspora!</p>
