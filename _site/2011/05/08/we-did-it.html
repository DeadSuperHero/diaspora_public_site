<p>Everyone!</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t believe it only took us twelve days to reach our goal. We have gotten so much support and exposure thanks to all of you that we could barely keep up with all of your emails, updates, and comments. We really appreciate people who continue to back us, it makes us so pumped to get started on the project. We think people&#8217;s privacy and personal control is in jeopardy more than ever online, and every day we hear about more and more of our peers who say that Diaspora is something that they want and need.</p>
Your comments, updates, and emails are all still very appreciated. We also want to extend a special thank you to all of our many international backers (we promise we are going to find you a way to get you your rewards&#8230;we had no idea we would get such worldwide support)! We are really excited that our summer is going to become a reality, and can&#8217;t wait to make Diaspora the social application we all need.
<p>Right now, for the Diaspora team, we have to finish school/graduate. Then, we are going to spend a week or two getting ready for three months of intense coding. We will try and update our blog (and even our Kickstarter) periodically over the summer, but for the most part we are going to be in recluse programmer mode. If you want to see what we are up to, we will be hanging out on the <span class="caps">GNU</span> Social mailing list, as well as a few other places as we work on defining some common protocols between like minded projects.</p>
<p>As always, you can check out our <a href="http://www.joindiaspora.com">website</a> for updates, and follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/joindiaspora">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://identi.ca/joindiaspora">Identica</a>, and soon, on Diaspora itself!</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Maxwell, Daniel, Raphael and Ilya</p>
<p>The Diaspora Team</p>
