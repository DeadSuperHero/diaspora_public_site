&lt;p&gt;talk about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;talk about a social graph, why owning it is beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//from the old pitch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distributed network, where totally separate computers connect to each other directly, will let us connect without surrendering our privacy.  We call these computers &amp;#8216;seeds&amp;#8217;.  A seed is owned by you, hosted by you, or on a rented server.  Once it has been set up, the seed will aggregate all of your information: your facebook profile, tweets, anything.  We are designing an easily extendable plugin framework for Diaspora, so that whenever newfangled content gets invented, it will be automagically integrated into every seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have your information in your seed, it will connect to every service you used to have for you.  For example, your seed will keep pulling tweets and you will still be able to see your Facebook newsfeed.  In fact, Diaspora will make those services better!  Upload an image to Flickr and your seed can automatically generate a tweet from the caption and link.  Social networking will just get better when you have control over your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seed will not just be all your existing networks put together, though.  Decentralizing lets us reconstruct our “social graphs” so that they belong to us. Our real social lives do not have central managers, and our virtual lives do not need them.  Friend another seed and the two of you can synchronize over a direct and secure connection instead of through a superfluous hub.  Encryption (privacy nerds: we’re using &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPG&lt;/span&gt;) will ensure that no matter what kind of content is being transferred, you can share privately. Eventually, today&amp;#8217;s hubs could be almost entirely replaced by a decentralized network of truly personal websites. Here is more what think about that &amp;lt;-link!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>From Me, With Love</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;From Me, With Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;20 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;APRIL&lt;/span&gt; 2010 by daniel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a GMail account, and it&amp;#8217;s fantastic.  I have a twitter account, which is also great.  I have a last.fm &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;they&amp;#8221; log what I listen to.  I have a Flickr account.  I have an Apple ID, an iPhone, and a &amp;#8220;completely closed&amp;#8221; laptop running Mac OS X.  My headphones are not open-source.  I purchase copyrighted music from &amp;#8220;large corporations.&amp;#8221;  The lightbulbs I use are patented.  I bought my boots from a store which has logged my transaction for their financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;i&gt;shoot me&lt;/i&gt;.  I obviously don&amp;#8217;t care about my privacy, or the well-being of modern man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is not Big Brother, it is a privatized company.  The United States will not sudenly become a Fascist state.  We have nothing to worry about.  You have nothing to worry about.  As it is impossible to be citizens of the internet, a &amp;#8220;large internet company&amp;#8221; merely existing doesn&amp;#8217;t harm us as a people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our dreams &amp;#8211; our experiences &amp;#8211; are voluntary; however, what we choose to do with them is not.  The internet is, like anything else a medium for expressing ourselves.  We do not involuntarily run around expelling our deepest, darkest secrets; we do not  frantically slather them on the sides of houses.  History tells us we have some remote sense of sanity.  We are not naive as some would like to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not working on Diaspora to create a false revolution.  My efforts are not a result of some deep-seeded fury.  Diaspora is the next logical step in improving the Internet.  Retaining ownership of content instead of voluntarily submitting it is intuitive; I declare it to be the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
