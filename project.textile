* __Upload of photos and albums__
* __All traffic is signed and encrypted (except photos, for now).__

h3. Near Future.
* __data portability: allow people to Oauth to a new seed and move their entire account to the new seed, and then notify all of their contacts of the change, so people can move around seamlessly.__
* __services integration: We are going to be focusing on public publishing to Facebook, Twitter, and OStatus enabled public sites, as well as being able to get your existing friends lists to help you find them on Diaspora.__
* __Internationalization using I18n: We need to move our text out to locale files so that we can get Diaspora translated. It would be a shame if your couldn’t use Diaspora in Greek.__
* __In order to scale app-servers horizontally, we need to break the websocket server into a different process and store its session info in the database.__
* __Server to server authentication: Right now Diaspora is push-only. We need servers to be able to authenticate to each other in order to pull data in, and to delegate that authentication to the browser to avoid replicating large files like photos.__
* __refining aspects (adding people to multiple aspects, having people only in the public aspects, ect)__
